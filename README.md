Development Setup & Contribution Notes

Development Environment

This project was developed using one shared computer:

- Some team members use macOS and were not familiar with setting up the full stack (Django, PostgreSQL, Node, etc.).
- To save time and avoid environment issues, we used a single Windows machine with everything configured.
- All three members took turns using the same computer to develop and test the system.
- Therefore, all commits in this repository are under the same GitHub account: `JohnnyYew1`.

Contribution Marking (`done by`)

To record who actually implemented each feature, we used the following rule in commit messages:

- If a commit message contains `done by Justin Ong`, that work was implemented by Justin Ong.
- If a commit message contains `done by Tan Yien Win`, that work was implemented by Tan Yien Win.
- All commits that do NOT contain any `done by ...` note are implemented by _Yew Wen Jun_.

This way, even though we share one GitHub account,  
the real contribution of each team member is still clearly documented.
